# About

Hello! This is Harry's dev blog! I love building things, and built too many things, and now I'm making myself write about them.

This blog uses 11ty and I'm working off of this <a href="https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-base-blog">base-blog template</a>. I like the idea of a static website blog, as I don't really need to host a wordpress and edit there.
